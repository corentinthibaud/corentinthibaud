### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome on my GitHub Profile

## Who am I ?

I am a student, a developper oriented on C and website languages and a streamer (<a href="https://twitch.tv/cocomclive">@CocoMCLive</a>)!

You can also get to know me more by following at my LinkedIn, I promise you the curriculum is up to date (<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/corentin-thibaud/">My LinkedIn</a>)

## What can you find on my profile ?

On this repo, you will be able to find some of the projects I've worked on for my studies (identified by #isen), and some personal projects. I did forked some project to enable a quicker access to the documentation and/or I am waiting on a certain update to make it worth while using it everyday (identified by #opensource).

## Why aren't all your project open ?
On all my school project I worked with multiple people. As such, I do not own all the repos, or if I do, there is a reason why it is in private. Would you like to know more about one of the project ? First, I have to find the time to complete it before making it available to you. No promise on when or what will be out next !
