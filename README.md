### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome on my GitHub Profile

## Who am I?

I am a student, a developper oriented on C and website languages and a streamer (<a href="https://twitch.tv/cocomclive">@CocoMCLive</a>)!

## What can you find on this repo?

On this repo, you will be able to find some of the projects I've worked on for my studies (identified by #isen), and some personal projects. I did forked some project to enable a quicker access to the documentation and/or I am waiting on a certain update to make it worth while using it everyday (identified by #opensource).
